# Dynamics 365 Artifact Management

The Artifact Management Solution is an add-on feature to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement which acts as a rule engine for generating **_artifacts_**; a custom entity that hosts files uploaded by system users and portal users populated with contextual metadata. This solution benefits organizations with a need to require/recommend certain files be uploaded based on a defined set of rules.  It also benefits organizations with a desire to manage files solely in Dynamics 365 instead of leveraging SharePoint Integrations.

## Installing
